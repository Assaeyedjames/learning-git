			<h1><strong>Kiss the sky</strong></h1>
			<small>by Shawn Lee's Ping Pong Orchestra</small>
			<blockquote>
				<p>I hold my head up just enough to see the sky<br/>
				And when we go we won't go slow we'll put up such a fight<br/>
				When they fade into the dust and into ash<br/>
				All children know this pain will surely pass<br/>
				Strong and wise and they are love<br/>
				When the tide it come they will float above and<br/>
				And you will be one day exactly what you are<br/>
				Just keep your head up high kiss your fist and touch the sky</p>
				<p>It's not too late to keep the world from dying<br/>
				It's not too late to spread the love you have<br/>
				One day when we are ready for crying<br/>
				One day I know we'll all be there</p>
				<p>The sound we hear it is our hearts they are in time<br/>
				They're poundig clear and swift the beat forever in our minds<br/>
				It gives us hope it gives the strenghth, you know, to carry on<br/>
				Keep fighting till the end and past the end we will be strong</p>
				<p>It's not too late to keep the world from dying<br/>
				It's not too late to spread the love and share<br/>
				One day I know we'll all be there</p>
				<p>Yes we will</p><br/>
